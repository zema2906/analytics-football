      <td class="club">
        <h1>Raphael Varane</h1>
        <h2>REAL MADRID (FRANCE) | Age: 24</h2>
        <p>Legend has it that when Zinedine Zidane called and asked him to join Real Madrid in 2011, an 18-year-old Raphael Varane asked the former galactico to call back later as he was studying for an exam. Such precociousness and seriousness has been characteristic of Varane's career. Just 18 months later he was scoring in a Clasico against Barcelona and supplanting the more experienced Pepe in Madrid's first team. By 2014 he was starting at the World Cup finals; later that year, he became the youngest-ever French national team captain in 2014. Regular injuries have been an issue, but when fit, there are few physically or technically better defenders than Varane.</p>

      <td class="club"><h1>Virgil van Dijk</h1>
      <h2>LIVERPOOL (NETHERLANDS) | Age: 27</h2>
      <p>Van Dijk is a right-footed centre back, who usually features on the left-hand side of central defence, although he can also play as a right-sided centre back. Neil McGuinness, senior scout at Celtic when Van Dijk was signed, called him "everything you would want if you could create a profile of the ideal central defender", praising him as a "very smooth ball-playing defender" who possesses aerial prowess, skills from dead ball situations, and "strong leadership qualities", while commenting that since his move to England, he is "more tactically aware now [...] his anticipation and timing has improved and he is a lot more of an all-rounder". McGuinness believes Van Dijk's "biggest problem" is that he "can switch off when the game is comfortable".</p>

      <td class="club"><h1>Sergio Ramos</h1>
      <h2>REAL MADRID (SPAIN) | Age: 31</h2>
      <p>Few players divide opinion like Sergio Ramos. The Spain and Madrid captain is a hero at the Bernabeu, in no small part thanks to a series of crucial headed goals starting with his 93rd minute equaliser in the 2014 Champions League final. Other observers point to his at times reckless defending (and club record 23 red cards) but it's difficult to argue with Ramos' club and country trophy haul, plus he has been named eight times in the FIFPRO World XI, more than any other defender in history. His own view is pretty clear as he has more than once suggested himself as a potential Ballon d'Or winner. Ramos' blunt personality has also caused tension with former Madrid coach Jose Mourinho, and even current president Florentino Perez, but the Andalusian always comes out smiling in the end. </p></td>

      <td class="club"><h1>Samuel Umtity</h1>
      <h2>BARCELONA (FRANCE) | Age: 24</h2>
      <p>Umtiti is a central defender. In 2018, ESPN FC journalist Sam Marsden was effusive in praising Umtiti, opining that, "As well as reading the game as if it was a children's book, timing his challenges to the millisecond and putting his body on the line in the name of a block, [Umtiti] is a daring defender. [...] He takes risks, feeding the ball between the lines, and rarely picks the wrong option", going on to say, "Of the six summer signings Robert Fernandez made in 2016, Umtiti has proved the sporting director's Mona Lisa [...] Barca should make sure they follow through on their threat to up their security on a player who has the potential to not just keep improving, but who could lead their defence for the next five to 10 years".</p></td>

      <td class="club"><h1>Marcelo</h1>
      <h2>REAL MADRID (BRAZIL) | Age: 29</h2>
      <p>"Until I was 16 years old, I didn't even know there was a Champions League," Marcelo wrote on the Players Tribune this year. Such apparent innocence fits with the idea of the happy-go-lucky left back, whose love of attacking -- he's created 287 scoring chances over the past eight seasons -- is sometimes undercut by a lack of defensive awareness. But that is to underestimate a player who has matured through the seasons. Now a vice-captain at Madrid and one of the senior figures in the dressing room, Marcelo is unafraid to call out his big-name colleagues when the team suffers a bad result. His all-round game has been recognised by selections to the FIFPro world XI in each of the past three years. </p></td>

      <td class="club"><h1>Diego Godin</h1>
      <h2>ATLETICO MADRID (URUGUAY) | Age: 31</h2>
      <p>Perhaps along with Gabi, Diego Godin is the player who most typifies Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid side. The Uruguay international has been a constant since he joined the club in 2010 and has become known for his "Braveheart"-like performances -- and the goal which won La Liga in 2014. Simeone has even joked that he would like to "clone" Godin, who has made more appearances for Atletico than any other non-Spanish player.</p></td>

      <td class="club"><h1>Gerard Pique</h1>
      <h2>BARCELONA (SPAIN) | Age: 30</h2>
      <p>Gerard Pique once suggested he'd walk away from the game at 30, but he's still here and he's still enjoying it. And both Barcelona and Spain are still dependent on him. He might not be in the form he was in this time last year, but when the big games roll around, his managers depend on him. It can't always be easy for Pique to keep his focus on the pitch, either. While he's become an unofficial spokesman for the people's right to decide on self-determination in Catalonia, he's also running a business (Kerad Games) and is in talks to create a World Cup-style event in tennis.</p></td>

      <td class="club"><h1>Kyle Walker</h1>
      <h2>MANCHESTER CITY (ENGLAND) | Age: 27</h2>
      <p>Kyle Walker has always attracted more than his fair share of criticism, and the jibes reached a crescendo this summer when he was signed by Manchester City for Â£54m. But it turns out that Pep Guardiola knows a little more than the critics because Walker has been excellent, fitting perfectly into a fluid, shifting side that was crying out for someone with his pace from full-back. And Walker has his feet on the ground. He carries a tattoo of the deprived housing estate in which he grew up and has offered advice to young players on Twitter. Maybe it's time the trolls found a new target.</p></td>

      <td class="club"><h1>Mats Hummels</h1>
      <h2>BAYERN MUNICH (GERMANY) | Age: 28</h2>
      <p>Centre-backs don't come much more cultured. Hummels sprays pin-point passes with the outside of his boot in the vein of Franz Beckenbauer and never, ever looks harried even when he spills a hot cup of coffee over himself. His elegance belies deceptively quick feet as well as a willingness to put his body in harm's way. Engaging and honest on social media, Hummels recently said that he saw himself as one of the world's top five central defenders. It's impossible to disagree.</p></td>
