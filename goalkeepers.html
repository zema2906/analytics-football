        <h1>David De Gea</h1>
        <h2>MANCHESTER UNITED (SPAIN) | Age: 26 </h2>
        <p>It's hard to believe now that he was once considered a flop. The willowy youngster endured a nightmare debut at Wembley in the Community Shield in 2011 and the slip-ups just kept coming. One reporter described him as "a kid who'd won a competition to play in goal for United." Now, of course, he's one of the greatest goalkeepers on the planet, blessed with supernatural reflexes and a reach like Stretch Armstrong. On balance, his critics may have been a little hasty.</p>

      <h2>BAYERN MUNICH (GERMANY) | Age: 31</h2>
      <p>The year 2017 hasn't been kind to Germany's No. 1. Neuer broke his foot in the Champions League quarterfinal defeat by Real Madrid in April and suffered a recurrence of the same injury just three games into this season. Nevertheless, his enduring excellence and role-redefining "keepero" style has remained hugely influential well beyond the confines of the Allianz Arena. His broad frame and ice-cool demeanour mark him out as football's most daunting goalkeeper in an age where more acrobatic versions are coming to the fore.</p>

      <h2>REAL MADRID (BELGIUM) | Age: 25</h2>
      <p>It was never going to be easy to replace Petr Cech at Chelsea but Thibaut Courtois made it look as though it was. The enormous Belgium international had been the Blues' worst-kept secret: a young goalkeeper so good that he was on loan at arguably a more successful club. Atletico Madrid wanted to keep him, but Chelsea were ready to act given Courtois' record: He's one of only four goalkeepers in Europe's top five leagues with more than 90 clean sheets since 2011. Out went club legend Cech, in came Courtois. Oddly enough, they won the title that season.</p></td>

      <h2>LIVERPOOL (BRAZIL) | Age: 24</h2>
      <p>On 19 July 2018, Liverpool officially confirmed the signing of Alisson for a fee of £66.8 million (€72.5 million), making him the most expensive goalkeeper of all time, surpassing the transfers of Ederson Moraes (most expensive in pound sterling) and Gianluigi Buffon (most expensive in Euros). However, the fee was broken just four weeks later when Chelsea signed Kepa Arrizabalaga for a reported £71 million (€78.8 million) from Athletic Bilbao. On 10 August, Liverpool confirmed via their official website that he will wear the vacant number 13 shirt in the 2018–19 season.</p></td>

      <h2>ATLETICO MADRID (SLOVENIA) | Age: 24</h2>
      <p>Few neutrals or Atletico Madrid fans knew very much about Oblak when he joined from Benfica for €16 million in 2014. Coach Diego Simeone also took some convincing, but not anymore. In his first 125 games for the club, Oblak conceded fewer goals per game (0.64) and kept more clean sheets (71) than predecessor Thibaut Courtois, now at Chelsea. The 24-year-old Slovenia international has also saved six of the 10 penalties he's faced in open play during his time at Atletico. Had he saved at least one spot-kick in 2016's Champions League final shootout against Real Madrid, his standing would be even higher.</p></td>

      <h2>BARCELONA (GERMANY) | Age: 25</h2>
      <p>Ter Stegen has always been nifty with his feet, but this season he's showing that he's not bad with his hands, either, which is what's important for a goalkeeper. Now Barcelona's undisputed No. 1 after spending his first two years at the club battling Claudio Bravo for the job, he's not only more mature but more confident, too: since taking over that starting role he's got the highest save percentage across Europe's top five leagues. There's no reason he can't stick around at Camp Nou for the next decade while also turning his attention to wrestling Manuel Neuer out of the Germany job.</p></td>

      <h2>PSG (ITALY) | Age: 39</h2>
      <p>Upon receiving the award for top goalkeeper at FIFA's "The Best" ceremony in London last month, Buffon more than once referred to the joy of achieving such recognition "at my age." It was a humble statement, acknowledging the fortune that has brought him this far over a two-decade career, but it could just as easily have been wonderment at his own continued excellence. Buffon is that rare example of a veteran footballer who seems to get better with age, and it will be a huge loss to the game if he retires after the World Cup. Buffon, a wonderful player and ambassador for the sport, is one of football's genuine treasures.</p></td>

      <h2>TOTTENHAM (FRANCE) | Age: 30</h2>
      <p>It was a good thing that Tottenham stepped up and consolidated their status as regular title challengers, because for a long time it seemed that Hugo Lloris was far too good for them. A goalkeeper of unimpeachable credentials, combining world class shot-stopping with the intelligence and speed to play off his line, he must go down as one of the club's best signings in recent years. Had he wanted to cause trouble, he could have forced a move to anywhere in Europe. Perhaps his loyalty will soon be rewarded with silverware.</p></td>

      <td class="club"><h1>Ederson</h1>
      <h2>MANCHESTER CITY (BRAZIL) | Age:24</h2>
      <p>An agile, courageous, energetic, and physically imposing keeper, Ederson possesses physical strength, excellent reflexes and shot-stopping abilities between the posts, and developed a reputation as a penalty saving specialist during his time with Benfica. However, he is mostly highly regarded for his outstanding distribution and skill with the ball at his feet: his control and confidence on the ball enables him to retain possession and quickly play the ball out from the back on the ground with his hands or either foot – even when put under pressure – or launch an attack with long kicks.</p></td>
