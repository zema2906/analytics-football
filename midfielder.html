        <h1>Luka Modric</h1>
        <h2>REAL MADRID (CROATIA) | Age: 32</h2>
        <p>In January 2013, Spanish sports newspaper Marca called Real Madrid's €30 million purchase from Tottenham the worst signing of the entire season. Modric did not react at the time but a few weeks later he hammered home a crucial Champions League goal at Manchester United. The rest is literally history as his passing and invention set the pace and direction of many games on Los Blancos' march to dominating Europe. Modric may not have the global galactico status of some of his teammates, but nobody questions the slight and quietly spoken Croatia international who could now be the world's best pound-for-pound midfielder.</p></td>

      <td class="club"><h1>Toni Kroos</h1>
      <h2>REAL MADRID (GERMANY) | Age: 27</h2>
      <p>In 2014, Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge reportedly told the team's homegrown midfielder Toni Kroos, then 23, that his wage demands were excessive "because you're not a world-class player." Kroos is not afraid to buck convention -- see his liking for unfashionable popstar Robbie Williams and insistence on wearing the same old battered boots each game -- but he knows his own worth. Refusing to re-sign with Bayern resulted in his cut-price €25 million move to Real Madrid. The former No. 10 was given a deeper role at the Bernabeu but has adapted his game without complaint. A quiet galactico who rarely misplaces a pass, nobody questions Kroos' status now.</p>

      <td class="club"><h1>Kevin De Bruyne</h1>
      <h2>MANCHESTER CITY (BELGIUM) | Age: 26</h2>
      <p>Kevin de Bruyne's talents have been obvious for some time, at least to everyone except Jose Mourinho, who sold him while manager of Chelsea. What wasn't obvious was his ideal role. With that dexterous touch on the ball, was he a No. 10? He's two-footed and quick, so was he better out on the flanks? At the start of the 2017-18 season, Pep Guardiola gave him an extended run in the heart of midfield and the debate was over. De Bruyne hit player of the year form almost instantly, directing everything that City do.</p></td>

      <td class="club"><h1>N'Golo Kante</h1>
      <h2>CHELSEA (FRANCE) | Age: 26</h2>
      <p>Nuclear-powered, steel-lunged N'Golo Kante is the ultimate, all-purpose midfielder. He moves so swiftly and so smartly that there seem to be at least two of him on the pitch at any given time. He tackles so firmly that he can single-handedly shut down a team. He passes so well that he can create with the same ease with which he destroys. There is no team in the world that wouldn't be improved by his presence -- so much so that he won the Premier League with two different teams (Leicester and Chelsea) in consecutive seasons. Just think: three-and-a-half years ago, he was in the French second division.</p></td>

      <td class="club"><h1>Paul Pogba</h1>
      <h2>MANCHESTER UNITED (FRANCE) | Age: 24</h2>
      <p>In his first season back at Manchester United, plenty of pundits moaned that Paul Pogba was a waste of money at €105 million. In his second season, his injury was pinpointed by those same people as the reason for United's failure to keep up with Manchester City. How things change. The truth is that Pogba just needed to find his role in Jose Mourinho's team -- and how he found it. Underneath the hyperbole, the hair and the emoji is a supremely gifted midfielder who combines exceptional talent with the highest physical attributes. The terrifying thing is that he can still get better.</p></td>

      <td class="name" id = "Silva"></td>
      <td class="club"><h1>David Silva</h1>
      <h2>MANCHESTER CITY (SPAIN) | Age: 31</h2>
      <p>The shaven head may be a new look but his playing style never changes. David Silva is the classic Iberian attacking midfielder; 5-foot-8 in bare feet, ludicrously gifted, faintly ethereal and capable of playing anywhere beyond the halfway line. Great players come and go and reputations rise and fall at City, but he remains a constant, flitting and zipping between the lines, creating and completing moves like a kid in the playground.</p></td>

      <td class="name" id = "Busquets"></td>
      <td class="club"><h1>Sergio Busquets</h1>
      <h2>BARCELONA (SPAIN) | Age: 29</h2>
      <p>Few players are more of an acquired taste than Sergio Busquets. You either hate him or you love him but luckily for the Spain midfielder, Barcelona managers have constantly fallen into the latter category. Pep Guardiola, Tito Vilanova, Gerardo Martino, Luis Enrique and Ernesto Valverde have all raved about him and used him as much as he could handle in that deep-lying playmaker role. When Busquets is at his best (which is more often than not) Barca are as well. He's also a key figure for Spain and will hope to help his country win a second World Cup in Russia next summer.</p></td>

      <td class="name" id = "Coutinho"></td>
      <td class="club"><h1>Philippe Coutinho</h1>
      <h2>BRCELONA (BRAZIL) | Age: 25</h2>
      <p>Philippe Coutinho isn't just Liverpool's best attacking threat, he's their Superman. When everything else has failed and there seems like they have no hope left, Coutinho is the only one who can save the day -- usually by taking a touch to make space 30 yards out and then sending the ball whistling into the top corner. Barcelona moved heaven and earth to land the Brazil international in the summer, but Liverpool wouldn't budge. It's an impressive rise for a player who was considered far too skinny and frail to succeed in an unhappy spell at Inter Milan.</p></td>

      <td class="club"><h1>Christian Eriksen</h1>
      <h2>TOTTENHAM (DENMARK) | Age: 25</h2>
      <p>Christian Eriksen had been on the radar of so many big clubs for so long that when he signed for Tottenham in 2013 instead of Manchester United or Barcelona, the assumption was that there must be something wrong. This is now his fifth season with Spurs and the only logical conclusion is that there must be something wrong with the big clubs who ignored him instead. He's the creative heartbeat of the finest Spurs side since Bill Nicholson left, and thanks in no small part to the Denmark international's efforts, Spurs can now be considered a big club in their own right.</p></td>
